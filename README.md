# Submarine simulator ðŸŒŠ
CS lab for first year university students (This is the associated simulation, not what the students have to do)

## How to run
After cloning the repo, don't forget to get the submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` 

## How to use
To move around in the simulation, you have to click in and use the WASD or arrow keys. Shift and Space are used to control the depth of your submarine.
The _load file_ prompt is used to load the example out.json file, that will generate the environment (fish and plants)

## What is left to do:

- Fix the warnings in the console
- Move using force and not just direction
- Optimize
